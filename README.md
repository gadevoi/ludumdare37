# README
This game was made by Alexandre Mattenet (alex@mattenet.com)
for the Ludum Dare 37 compo.

## description
Garden of Eden is a game about loneliness and growing transgenic plants on mars.
It uses ideas from the book [The algorithmic beauty of plants](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop) to simulate plants, and affect random mutations and gene crossing between different plant models.

All assets, including the music, were made by me.

## how to run
The game is made with [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) in [python 3](https://www.python.org/). If you have pygame, python3 and numpy installed, you should be able to run it. The main python file is game.py.

### linux
if you have all the packages installed, `cd` to garden_of_eden and run
```
$python3 game.py
```

### windows and mac
I don't know very well, try to install pygame, numpy and python from the links provided, ensuring that you're using version 3.something and not 2.7, then try to click on game.py

# README
This game was made by Alexandre Mattenet (alex@mattenet.com)
for the Ludum Dare 37 compo.

## description
Garden of Eden is a game about loneliness and growing transgenic plants on mars.

## how to run
The game is made with pygame in python3. If you have pygame, python3 and numpy installed, you should be able to run it. The main python file is game.py.

On linux, running "run.sh" should do it
On windows, hopefully running "run.bat" should do it
On mac i have no idea, try running "run.sh" too?

If you know your way around a terminal, simply go to the garden_of_eden folder and run "python3 game.py"
